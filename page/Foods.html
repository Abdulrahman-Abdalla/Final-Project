						<h4>Hummus:</h4>
						<h6><p>Hummus is probably one of the best known Middle Eastern foods due to its popularity worldwide. The chickpea based dip can be found in most conventional grocery stores in north America and on many non Middle Eastern restaurant menus.
						The word hummus comes from the Egyptian word for chickpeas, the typical primary ingredient, although lots of other beans can be used instead. Variations of the modern day hummus recipe can be found as early as the 13th century in Egyptian cookbooks.</p></h6>

						<h4>Labneh:</h4>
						<h6><p> What exactly is labneh? It's a soft, cream cheese made from strained yogurt, that's popular in Middle Eastern cuisine.

						<h4>Dolma:</h4>
						<h6><p>  Middle Eastern cuisine is well known for its stuffed and wrapped vegetable dishes called 'dolma' and 'sarma.' Tiny green peppers stuffed with rice, pine nuts, and currants, better known as 'biber dolmasÄ±' (bee-BEYR' dole-MAH'-suh), are one of the most popular. They are easier to make than other stuffed and wrapped dishes because the peppers don't need much preparation. Just remove the stems with your thumb and they're ready for stuffing.</p></h6>

						<h4>Umm Ali:</h4>
						<h6><p>Umm Ali, also called Om Ali (translated to Ali's Mother) is a national dish of Egypt. This scrumptious dessert is a Middle Eastern version of bread pudding and is often served with a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream on top. Unlike American bread puddings, which typically use stale bread that's first soaked in a sweet liquid, Umm Ali uses freshly baked puff pastry for an extra level of deliciousness.</p></h6>

						<h4>Baklava:</h4>
						<h6><p>Since the main ingredients of baklava are phyllo dough, nuts and the syrup, I looked for ways to incorporate them individually. The phyllo dough makes a wonderful crust and I've used it that way before for other pastries, both sweet and savory. The nuts, pistachio are my favorite for baklava, can easily go on top of the cheesecake batter. As for the syrup, the phyllo is unsweetened and definitely needs it. But I kept the cheesecake batter a little less sweet and gave it plenty of acid from the lemon juice to allow for the extra sweetness in the honey syrup</p></h6>
